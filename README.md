# Balatro Shenanigans Mod
This mod currently adds 15 decks to the game. You can either discover the effects yourself or read below for each deck's description. Requires Steamodded v0.9.8.

5 decks are themed after the legendary jokers:
 - **Canio Deck**: Discarded cards have a 1 in 10 (increasable by Oops! All 6s) chance to be destroyed.
 - **Triboulet Deck**: Retrigger all Kings and Queens.
 - **Yorick Deck**: Discarded cards trigger their end of round effects. This works with Mime/Red Seal.
 - **Chicot Deck**: During the Boss Blind, your rightmost Joker triggers an additional time.
 - **Perkeo's Deck**: Get a Negative copy of every third consumable used.
The other current decks are themed after existing jokers/vouchers:
 - **Dusk Deck**: -1 hand per round, but each final hand is retriggered twice
 - **Gros Michel Deck**: The leftmost non-eternal Joker has a 1 in 6 chance to be destroyed at end of round. Start with a Gros Michel.
 - **Hieroglyph Deck**: Start at ante 0, but must reach ante 10 to win.
 - **Freaky Deck**: Each Joker is assigned as a 'Freaky 6', or 'Freaky 9'. After scoring, any 'Freaky 6' adjacent to a 'Freaky 9' gives 1.5x mult.
 - **Showman Deck**: Adds copies of each card you own to the pool so that it's more likely to appear again.
 - **Snakeskin Deck**: After play or discard, always draw 3 cards (constant effect of The Serpent boss blind).
 - **Turtle Bean Deck**: +5 hand size, this bonus decreases by 1 after each discard/hand played. Resets after defeating the Boss Blind.
 - **Temple Deck**: (UNFINISHED) You can find Temple Games which upgrade your deck in the shop.
 - **Cartomancer Deck**: Create a specific Tarot card when Blind is selected, changes each Ante (so you essentially get 3 copies of it per Ante if you don't skip).
 - **Diplopia Deck**: After defeating each Boss Blind, gain a Negative Perishable copy of a random Joker you own.
